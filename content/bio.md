I'm a PhD Student in Psychology at Stanford University advised by [Dr. Nilam Ram](https://thechangelab.stanford.edu/) and [Dr. Johannes Eichstaedt](https://jeichstaedt.com/). My research employs AI and longitudinal methods to study affect, wellbeing and mental health. I'm also associated with the [World Well-Being Project](https://www.wwbp.org/) where I collaborate to develop NLP methods to measure psychological states of individuals and populations. 

I'm always eager to connect with others working at the intersection of AI and Psychology, or in related areas. If you're interested in sharing ideas or exploring potential collaborations, please [schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/ssbrahma/shashanka-s-office-hours).
