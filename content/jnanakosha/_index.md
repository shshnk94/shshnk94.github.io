# Jñānakosha

Jñānakosha is a collection of my occasional blog posts. Jñānakosha (Sanskrit: ज्ञानकोश) is a combination of "jñāna" meaning knowledge and "kosha" meaning repository, or collection. Thus, Jñānakosha refers to a repository of knowledge - a collection where knowledge is gathered, preserved, or compiled.
